# Enterprise Level Network Topology 

This project is designed as a part of a grad course Advanced Network Design at SMU. The Toplogy itself is designed already by the professor and the TAs of the course. I, as student, am responsible only to make the network up an running using variety of network protocols at Layer 3 and at Layer 2.
